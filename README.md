**Replication Instructions:**

All do-files are in the folder **codeSTATA**. 

To replicate all empirical results:
1.	Designate user and directory in “0_runme.”
2.	Run lines 1-46 of “0_runme” to import data. 
3.	Run “2a_sumstats” to create Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 2, and Table 4. 
4.	Run “2b_mainregs_rins” to create Table 5 and Table 6. 
5.	Run “2c_mainregs_commodities” to create Table 7 and Online Appendix Tables B.5 and B.6. 
6.	Run “2d_mainregs_stocks” to create Table 8. 
7.	Run “3a_robust_rins” to create Online Appendix Tables B.1, B.2, B.3, B.4, and B.8. 

All figures will be saved in the folder **figSTATA** and all tables will be saved in the folder **tablesSTATA**.
